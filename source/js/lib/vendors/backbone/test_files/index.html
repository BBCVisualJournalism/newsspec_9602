	<p><strong>As we live longer and with council budgets tight, the social care system that supports us in our later years is under increasing pressure.</strong></p><p>The way care is provided is different depending on where you live. In England, important changes are planned for April 2016. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also making changes to meet the growing demand for support.</p><p>Where ever you live we hope the following guide will help you understand more about the way care works, what you need to think about and how much you may have to pay.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="intro-message intro-message__england" style="display: block;">
	<p>From April 2016 the amount you pay for care if you are over 65 is being capped at £72,000. Depending on your wealth, you may be entitled to help sooner.</p><p>To be eligible, you first need to be assessed by your council as having very high needs. Whether care is provided in your home or in a residential home, only the rate set by the council will count towards the cap. Any extra costs or top up fees will not count, nor will living costs. In residential care, you will be responsible for your food and lodging. A flat rate of £230 a week is proposed.</p>
